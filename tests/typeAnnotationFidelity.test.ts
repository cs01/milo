// A type annotation must mean what it says, or be refused.
//
// The failure this exists to prevent is not "a type is unsupported" — it is a type that is
// ACCEPTED and silently means a different one. `MiloType` carries a single `isArray` flag,
// so the parser built an array type from its inner type's NAME alone and dropped
// everything else about it. The result:
//
//     var g: [[i64; 2]; 2] = [1, 2]     // accepted, and `g` was an [i64; 2]
//     var a: [&string; 2]  = ["x","y"]  // accepted, and `a` was an OWNED [string; 2]
//     fn total(a: [Vec<i64>; 2])        // resolved to a plain Vec<i64>, array dropped
//
// Nothing was missing at the call site to notice: a flat literal satisfied a nested
// annotation, so the mismatch surfaced far away as invalid LLVM IR, or as an error about a
// type the program never wrote ("cannot iterate over type 'i64'").
//
// So the property here is fidelity, checked from the outside: a literal of the WRONG shape
// must not satisfy an annotation, and an annotation the type system cannot represent must
// be refused rather than quietly reinterpreted. Both directions are asserted, because a
// checker that rejected everything would pass half of this.
