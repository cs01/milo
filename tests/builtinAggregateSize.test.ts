// The size codegen COMPUTES for each builtin aggregate must match the type it EMITS.
//
// `typeSize()` answers in bytes and drives struct field offsets, aggregate memcpy lengths
// and array strides. It used to spell those answers out — `if (ty === "%HashMap") return
// 32; // ptr + i64 + i64 + i64` — beside a type definition written out separately. Adding
// the tombstone counter to %HashMap changed the definition and left the constant at 32, so
// every struct holding a map got an 8-byte-short memcpy.
//
// Nothing in `bun test` noticed. The fixtures that put a map in a struct still passed,
// because the bytes that stopped being copied were the ones the test did not read. What
// caught it was the self-hosted compiler segfaulting on its first lookup — src-milo is full
// of structs with HashMap fields — and that gate only runs on a commit touching src-milo/,
// std/ or the selfhost scripts. A src/-only commit can break the bootstrap and nothing here
// says a word.
//
// So: compare the two directly. Emit a program using all three aggregates, parse the type
// definitions out of the IR, and check each against typeSize.
