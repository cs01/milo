// `main` runs as a green task whenever the program can spawn one.
//
// The bug this locks down had no diagnostic: a blocking std call in `main` read
// `schedulerCurrent()` as 0, took the OS-blocking path, and starved the green
// tasks that would have satisfied it. `accept` in `main` with the peer in a
// `Task.spawn` simply stopped forever.
//
// So case 1 is written to HANG if the fix regresses, and the timeout is the
// assertion — an "it ran" check that cannot tell a fixed program from a hung one
// would be worthless here. Case 3 is the other half: the wrapper must NOT appear
// in a program that never spawns, or every hello-world would drag in the
// ucontext scheduler and wasm/bare-metal (which have no stackful coroutines)
// would stop building.
