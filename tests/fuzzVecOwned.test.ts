// The Vec falsifier again, with OWNED elements and a leak oracle.
//
// The value model and the leak oracle see different bugs, and the leak ones are the class
// that actually shipped: `m.get("k" + i.toString())` and `mkVec().len` produced entirely
// correct answers while losing an allocation per call. No amount of checking what a
// program PRINTS can see that.
//
// `--owned` switches the element type to string, which turns on drop glue for every op and
// makes the generator emit the two shapes that leaked: a needle BUILT at the call site (a
// literal never leaks — it owns no heap) and a receiver that is a temporary.
//
// macOS only: this uses `leaks -atExit`, and LeakSanitizer does not exist on darwin/arm64
// so the Linux job covers the same ground through scripts/leak-check.ts instead.
