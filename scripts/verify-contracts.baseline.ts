// Accepted (baselined) contract refutations.
//
// These are contracts `milo prove` reports as
// `failed` today that are NOT bugs — they are true facts the current native
// solver cannot establish (chiefly struct invariants, which prove-milo does not
// model yet — see docs/verification-roadmap.md). The gate fails on any refuted
// contract NOT listed here, so a genuinely broken contract breaks the build
// while these known solver limits do not. Burn this list down as the verifier
// gains power; the gate also flags a stale entry that has become provable.

    "`error = setpoint - measured` is a subtraction of two i32s, so the unbounded-Int " +
    "model lets it reach -2^32 and refutes. In the real program that subtraction would " +
    "trap on overflow in a debug build long before fpMul is reached, so the values are " +
