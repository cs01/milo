// Every itable carries a destructor slot, and it is filled for a type that has one.
//
// Boxing a value behind an interface erases its concrete type. The itable is the only
// thing that survives that erasure, and it used to carry method pointers ONLY — so a value
// in a `Heap<Iface>` had its box freed and was never destroyed. RAII through polymorphism
// was silently a no-op, while the identical `Heap<Concrete>` was correct.
//
// The fix appends one slot after the methods: the concrete type's destructor, or null when
// it has none. Nothing structural forces that slot to keep existing, which is the same gap
// that produced the bug in the first place — so this asserts it from the emitted IR, where
// a regression shows up as a missing or misnamed pointer rather than as a destructor
// quietly not running.
//
// Appended rather than prepended so existing method indices stay valid; dispatch GEPs by
// index and never reads the struct type, which the slot count below also pins.
