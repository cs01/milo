// The HashMap falsifier with OWNED keys AND values, oracled by `leaks -atExit`.
//
// Its literal-only keys made it blind to the class that shipped: `m.get("k" + i.toString())`
// leaked its key on every call while returning entirely the right answer. `--owned` makes
// values strings too and builds lookup keys from a runtime value, so the argument-temp path
// is actually exercised.
//
// It found HashMapGetOrDefault sitting in NOT_OWNED_TEMP beside `contains` and `len`,
// which really do yield scalars — so a discarded getOrDefault result leaked its clone.
//
// macOS only: `leaks` has no darwin/arm64 LeakSanitizer counterpart, and the Linux job
// covers the same ground through scripts/leak-check.ts.
