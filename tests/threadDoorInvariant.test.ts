// Holds the invariant that makes `checkThreadBoundary` sound: every OS thread a Milo
// program can create is spawned by a function marked `@thread`.
//
// The checker exempts green tasks from the mutable-global race rule because the scheduler
// is cooperative and single-threaded, so two green tasks never run at the same instant.
// That exemption is correct today and silently becomes unsound the moment the runtime
// gains a second scheduler thread (work stealing, a parallel poll loop, a helper worker) —
// and nothing would fail, because the rule would simply stop being applied to code that
// now races. An assumption no test can notice being broken is the worst kind, so this
// test is the tripwire: add a thread-creating call outside a `@thread` function and it
// goes red, pointing at the exemption that has to be revisited.
