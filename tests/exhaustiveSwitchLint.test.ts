// No switch over an AST or HIR node union may fall out of the switch silently.
//
// This exists because the same bug was found six times in two days, in unrelated places,
// and every instance reported SUCCESS: a prover walker that never descended into
// expressions proved `ensures result == 0` for a function returning 100; the contract gate
// silently skipped 11 files; `safety.ts` passed a DO-178C DAL A profile on an `unsafe`
// block inside `let .. else`; the cyclomatic-complexity counter measured a function 35%
// over the DAL A bound as complexity 2; `wcet.ts` emitted flow facts describing a bounded
// program that contained an unbounded loop; and the JS backend dropped statements it had
// no arm for. None of them failed a test — a walker that does not look finds nothing, and
// finding nothing reads as "nothing wrong".
//
// The rule is deliberately about SILENCE, not exhaustiveness. Plenty of these switches are
// partial on purpose: a lowering that answers "is this translatable" returns UNSUPPORTED
// for everything it does not know, which is a safe stated default. What is forbidden is
// having no answer at all — control simply leaving the switch with nothing said about the
// kind that got there. So a switch passes if it does any one of:
//
//   - binds the scrutinee to `never` (inside a `default:`, or after a switch whose every
//     arm returns) — the strongest form, since a new kind becomes a COMPILE error;
//   - has an explicit `default:` arm — the fallback is stated, even if it is a no-op;
//   - throws immediately after the switch — a stated, loud fallback.
//
// Value-returning switches get exhaustiveness from TypeScript for free (falling out would
// be "not all code paths return a value"), which is why the dangerous ones are almost
// always the `void` walkers.
