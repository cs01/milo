// `--expect=<warning>`: suppress the finding AND report if it stops occurring.
//
// `--allow` is silent forever. Nothing ever deletes it, so a suppression outlives the code
// it excused and the project keeps claiming a lint it no longer needs. An expectation
// deletes itself: the moment the finding stops firing, the build says so.
//
// Two things make this more than a rename of `--allow`, and both are asserted here: an
// off-by-default lint has to be ENABLED by expecting it (otherwise it never runs, never
// fires, and reports itself unfulfilled against code that does contain the finding), and a
// misspelled warning name has to be refused rather than silently accepted.
