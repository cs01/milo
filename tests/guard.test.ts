  //           is the only thing that can stop it: guardKill "memory" + SIGKILL.
  //   Linux — enforces `ulimit -v`, which guardedRun sets. The allocation fails inside
  //           the child and it dies on its own (SIGTRAP/abort) before the watchdog is
  //           needed. A kernel-side cap is a better outcome, not a worse one.

  // guardKill at all: the allocator refused before the polling watchdog's next tick. That
  // is the kernel doing the guard's job, which is a better outcome than being SIGKILLed,
  // and it is indistinguishable here from the guard working perfectly.
  //
  // So check the mechanism only when the watchdog is what acted. This does not thin the
  // guard's coverage: "monitorPidTree kills an allocating child" and "shell watchdog
  // survives parent death and still kills the hog" exercise the watchdog directly and do
  // not depend on winning that race. What this test owns is the end-to-end property, and
