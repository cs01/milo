// The compile-pool budget for tests/run.test.ts, and the margin warning that fires before
// the budget becomes a failure.
//
// Extracted from the test file for one reason: a warning nobody can trigger is a gate that
// cannot fail. Driving it through the real pool means tuning a timeout until the compile
// lands in the 80-to-100 percent band, which is a coin flip on a loaded machine; as a pure
// function it is three assertions. See tests/poolBudget.test.ts.
//
// Why it scales at all: the budget used to be a flat 300s on posix, and at 683 fixtures a
// linux CI runner crossed it. Bun reports a blown `beforeAll` as `(unnamed) [300003ms]`,
// naming no fixture, so a corpus that had simply grown read as a hang in whichever commit
// happened to tip it over.
